This allows us to store information about the current node's tokens (which\n * can be shared in `TView`) as well as the tokens of its ancestor nodes (which cannot be\n * shared, so they live in `LViewData`).\n *\n * Each of these slots (aside from the last slot) contains a bloom filter. This bloom filter\n * determines whether a directive is available on the associated node or not. This prevents us\n * from searching the directives array at this level unless it's probable the directive is in it.\n *\n * See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter for more about bloom filters.\n *\n * Because all injectors have been flattened into `LViewData` and `TViewData`, they cannot typed\n * using interfaces as they were previously. The start index of each `LInjector` and `TInjector`\n * will differ based on where it is flattened into the main array, so it's not possible to know\n * the indices ahead of time and save their types here. The interfaces are still included here\n * for documentation purposes.\n *\n * export interface LInjector extends Array<any> {\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 0-31  (IDs are % BLOOM_SIZE)\n *    [0]: number;\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 32-63\n *    [1]: number;\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 64-95\n *    [2]: number;\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 96-127\n *    [3]: number;\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 128-159\n *    [4]: number;\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 160 - 191\n *    [5]: number;\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 192 - 223\n *    [6]: number;\n *\n *    // Cumulative bloom for directive IDs 224 - 255\n *    [7]: number;\n *\n *    // We need to store a reference to the injector's parent so DI can keep looking up\n *    // the injector tree until it finds the dependency it's looking for.\n *    [PARENT_INJECTOR]: number;\n * }\n *\n * export interface TInjector extends Array<any> {\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 0-31  (IDs are % BLOOM_SIZE)\n *    [0]: number;\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 32-63\n *    [1]: number;\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 64-95\n *    [2]: number;\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 96-127\n *    [3]: number;\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 128-159\n *    [4]: number;\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 160 - 191\n *    [5]: number;\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 192 - 223\n *    [6]: number;\n *\n *    // Shared node bloom for directive IDs 224 - 255\n *    [7]: number;\n *\n *    // Necessary to find directive indices for a particular node.\n *    [TNODE]: TElementNode|TElementContainerNode|TContainerNode;\n *  }\n */\n\n// Note: This hack is necessary so we don't erroneously get a circular dependency\n// failure based on types.\nexport const unusedValueExportToPlacateAjd = 1;\n"]}
